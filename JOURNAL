July 2015

CNCS
----

(in mcvine-resources) 
* upgraded mcstas files to 2.2a. problem: Al_window
* mcstas-1 files: added beam.instr. created example to run simulation

(in instrument)
* added instrument.factories.CNCS. copied from .HYSPEC and modify
* problem: implementation of instrument.factories is a bit messy
      and can use some refactoring
* added share/CNCS/CNCS_Definition.xml (copied from mantid)
* created tests/instrument/factories/CNCS (follow the structure in HYSPEC)
  - Note: cncs-mantid-idf.xml is slightly different from .../share/CNCS/CNCS_Definitions.xml copied from mantid


April 2015:
* Moving everything to github.
* The conversion from svn mostly follow
  http://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git
* For simple package without branches, just do the first two steps,
  and then push it to github
* For complex package with branches, follow the first 5 steps.
  We don't really use tags, so step 6 is unnecessary
* The tutorial at http://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git
  only works if conversion happen at once. no continuous integration
  possible.
* To convert mcvine repo, trying to follow
  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/migrating-prepare
* moved "examples" subdirs into mcvine-resources
* moved "instruments/ARCS/simulations" and "instruments/ARCS/resources" into mcvine-resources
* moved "instruments/SEQUOIA/resources" into mcvine-resources
* removed "pyre/packages/pyrev"
* moved "packages/mccomponents/tests/mccomponents/sample/phonon/data" into mcvine-resources
