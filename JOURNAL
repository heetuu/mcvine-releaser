April 2015:
* Moving everything to github.
* The conversion from svn mostly follow
  http://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git
* For simple package without branches, just do the first two steps,
  and then push it to github
* For complex package with branches, follow the first 5 steps.
  We don't really use tags, so step 6 is unnecessary
* The tutorial at http://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git
  only works if conversion happen at once. no continuous integration
  possible.

  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/migrating-prepare
