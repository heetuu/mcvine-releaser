Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

Please refer to installation
scripts in directory "install-deps". Those scripts can be directly
run if you really want to install all of the following dependencies.
But you might want to look carefully at those scripts
because some of them might
already be installed by you or your system administrator.

  0. Install Python if it is not in your system




Install
-------
  A quick installation:

    #extract files for tar ball
    tar xvfz <release-name>.tar.gz
    cd <release-name>
    #build and install
    ./setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/installation



Test
----
  Let us suppose that you have install journal to /usr/local/journal
  
    source /usr/local/journal/bin/envs.sh
    python
    >>> import journal
