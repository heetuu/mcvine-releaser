This HOWTO explains how to modify a template releaser
to suit a dveloper's special need.

1. check out releaser
 $ svn co svn+ssh://linjiao@strongbad.cacr.caltech.edu:/home/linjiao/repository/releaser

2. create new releaser using template
 $ cd releaser
 $ svn cp template <new_project>

3. In new releaser, make modifications

 $ cd <new_project>


3.0 revise subdir "deps"
external dependencies should go there

3.1 revise subdir packages
All of the following is insde directory "packages"

 $ cd packages

Following are the contents of the subdirectory "packages":

 __init__.py: gather global information about packages. don't touch
 bundles.py: packages are grouped into bundles. change it when new packages
             are added or when bundles need to be restructured
 defaults.py: default packages to be installed
 other modules: each module contains information about a specific package

   setupScript = name of distutils-adpt setup script
   path = path in 'src' directory
   sub_modules = names of sub modules (This is usually None. Only useful for DANSE:graphics)
   deps = names of dependencies
   checkoutCmd = command to check out the package from repository


3.1.1 revise bundles.py to add all packages. Separate them to bundles
is a good idea.
3,1,2 revise defaults.py to add default packages to be installed
3.1.3 for each package, add a python module with information about
that package.

4. For each package, write a setup script.

5. get sources

6. try to build by

 $ ./setup.py build
